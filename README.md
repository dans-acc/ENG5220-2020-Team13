## Description
The BeeSafe project is a low-cost, open source tracking device. It is designed to keep children safe by constantly monitoring their location, and alerting parents if the child leaves the designated safe zones. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3B, and a purpose made PCB containing a u-blox SARA-G350 GSM module, through which the Pi continuously gathers location data, and processes whether the child is in a location it is supposed to be at that time, and if the child is at a place they should not be, the device sends a text message to the parent with the childâ€™s location they can track through a web interface. 

## Installation
To build our project, first clone the BeeSafe Github repository with
<br>
`
git clone https://github.com/itsBelinda/ENG5220-2020-Team13
`
<br>
Next, run the installation script `installBeeSafe.sh` in the root folder of the repository: this will install all required dependencies. **Note:** For optional dependencies, you can choose to install them or not by uncommenting or commenting them in the installation script.
<br>
Next, run the build script `buildBeeSafe.sh` in the root folder of the repository: this will build the project and is ready to be ran.
