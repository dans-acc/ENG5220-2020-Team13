YAT (https://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/) needes to beinstalled on the (windows) machine.

 - Connect FTDI driver to the computer through USB.
 - Make sure the voltage levels on the FTDI chip comply with the Raspberry Pi (3.3V) 
 - open the SingleAutomaticResponseTemplate.yat file with YAT
 - re-define cmd 1 (expected command from PI) and cmd 2 (expected response from module)
 - define more commands to send by clicking on buttons on the sides

currently only one command possible (due to limitation of YAT)
