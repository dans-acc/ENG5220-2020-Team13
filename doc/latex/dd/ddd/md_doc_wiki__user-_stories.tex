\subsection*{Initial Plans}

Originally the team planned to have 2 Pis included in the project\+: 1 to serve as the server, handling updates and notifications based at home, and a smaller, possibly Pi Zero W as the device the child carries with them, and that microcontroller\textquotesingle{}s only job would be to get the location from the communication module attached to it, and transmit it to the server. Besides the two pieces of the system, the two key actors were the child, who may or may not go to school, and is always being mischievous, and the concerned parent who always wants to be up-\/to-\/date with what their child does.

These are the following\+:     With further releases the team would be very keen on revisiting those intial ideas and possibly incorporating them into the v2.\+0 release features.
