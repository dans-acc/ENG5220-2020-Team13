Currently in development.

\subsection*{Description}

The Bee\+Safe project is a low-\/cost, open source tracking device. It is designed to keep children safe by constantly monitoring their location, and alerting parents if the child leaves the designated safe zones. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3B, and a purpose made P\+CB containing a u-\/blox S\+A\+R\+A-\/\+G350 G\+SM module, through which the Pi continuously gathers location data, and processes whether the child is in a location it is supposed to be at that time, and if the child is at a place they should not be, the device sends a text message to the parent with the childâ€™s location they can track through a web interface.

\subsection*{Installation}

To build our project, first clone the Bee\+Safe Github repository with ~\newline
 ` git clone \href{https://github.com/itsBelinda/ENG5220-2020-Team13}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/its\+Belinda/\+E\+N\+G5220-\/2020-\/\+Team13} ` ~\newline
 Next, run the installation script {\ttfamily install\+Bee\+Safe.\+sh} in the root folder of the repository\+: this will install all required dependencies. {\bfseries Note\+:} For optional dependencies, you can choose to install them or not by uncommenting or commenting them in the installation script. ~\newline
 Next, run the build script {\ttfamily build\+Bee\+Safe.\+sh} in the root folder of the repository\+: this will build the project and is ready to be ran. \begin{quote}
For more in-\/depth build instructions, please see the corresponding \href{https://github.com/itsBelinda/ENG5220-2020-Team13/wiki/Build-Guide}{\tt wiki page }. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Usage}

To run the project as live project, ensure the build instructions were followed to create the bootloader service. If that was correctly implemented, the software should run upon the next startup. ~\newline
 To run the project in development, navigate into the folder {\ttfamily /software/\+Bee\+Safe\+P\+I/build/src/} in the repository, and type 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./BeeSafePI
\end{DoxyCode}
